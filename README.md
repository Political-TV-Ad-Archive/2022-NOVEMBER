How many politicians have the marketing data to say they are
at what percentage in the polls?

Why is that not a job a computer can do faster 
than a so called professional making us broke for his opponents tre?

(this is all i could find from past research going into this more)

Their is no correllation to populartity of
markets chosen to follow 
and markets of mass influence


This project is intended to kick off
the first of many for every election
given the FCC's ability to allow
these ads to be publicly distributed 
as a paid commercial to the general public

I see no reason as to why we can't view
this transparently as a national perspective
for the world to view for every election in 
a format similar to https://web.archive.org/
format!!

The Political TV Ad Archive collected and, using innovative open source technology, tracked airings of political ads in key markets the 2016 election cycle.

The collection also linked ads to fact-checks by national fact-checking organizations. In addition to tracking airings across key primary states, the collection includes ads that may air elsewhere or exclusively on social media.

Ideas? THought??
