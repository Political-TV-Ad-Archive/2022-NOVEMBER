Their is no correllation to populartity of
markets chosen to follow 
and markets of mass influence


This project is intended to kick off
the first of many for every election
given the FCC's ability to allow
these ads to be publicly distributed 
as a paid commercial to the general public

I see no reason as to why we can't view
this transparently as a national perspective
for the world to view for every election in 
a format similar to https://web.archive.org/
format!!

Ideas? THought??
