This project is intended to kick off
a multidiciplinary effort to make lists 
of various stats to baseline a perspective
of trifected markets through automated 
mass appeal.

Who in politics has the marketing data to say they are
at what percentage in the polls?

Why is this open source still? Is it public information?

Why use Julia or Python when the API is a screen scrapper on macro clicks?

Why know how to code it all when multiple dicipines can do the job with you?

Political ads broadcast 375,350 times over 26 markets

The map on link above shows markets chosen 
yet when comparing them to the rankings on this list.....

(this is all i could find from past research going into this more)

Their is NO NOPE NOT REALLY ANY correllation to populartity of
markets chosen to follow 
and markets of mass influence

This project is intended to kick off
a multidiciplinary effort to make lists 
of various stats to baseline a perspective
of trifected markets through automated 
mass appeal.

The first of many for every election
given the FCC's ability to allow
these ads to be publicly distributed 
as a paid commercial to the general public

I see no reason as to why we can't view
this transparently as a national perspective
for the world to view for every election in 
a format similar to https://web.archive.org/ (but think waybackmachine format from back in the day.......... when the links worked..) 
format!!

The Political TV Ad Archive collected and, using innovative open source technology, tracked airings of political ads in key markets the 2016 election cycle.

The collection also linked ads to fact-checks by national fact-checking organizations. In addition to tracking airings across key primary states, the collection includes ads that may air elsewhere or exclusively on social media.

Ideas? THought??

!!!Everyone interested including FinTECH Enthusiests are Welcome to join this FORE!!!

What kind of marketing insites would you gain from
this calculated stat after mutiple vote tallies for
multiple elections.

Why is this open source still?

Oh probably because this "project" got
funded for 1 political vote.

Is that ghetto slang for swing vote or the timing of when information is released
to neighboring cities of more influence?

Wouldn't this help with FOREX trading on a national level given
Russias private interest of goverment spending pre-Covid?

What about a teaphone booth for the USSR in America?
How about Ukraine?

Why is that not a job a computer can do faster and more 
transparently than CNN can bradcast?

Why is that not a job a computer can do faster than a so called professional making vote for his opponents team (AKA US)?
